“If you enjoy what you do you will never work a day in your life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just recently I was elated when a client contacted us. We have
been working on an ongoing project with them for over two years. They
contacted us just to let us know they had used the project as a
demo and witness. They used the project to help acquire funding for twenty-five full
scholarships for youth from all
over the world to attend any educational insitutue of their choosing.
My project manager read the email to me and I got goosebumps. A
project that I worked on will actually be making a major difference in twenty-five
young peoples lives.&lt;/p&gt;
